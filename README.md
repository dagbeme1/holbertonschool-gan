**Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Advanced GAN Experimentation**

This repository contains implementations and experiments with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and advanced GAN architectures for complex image generation using TensorFlow and Keras.

**Introduction**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that have shown remarkable capabilities in generating synthetic data. DCGANs, in particular, are designed for image generation tasks and have been widely used for various applications, including art generation and data augmentation.

In this repository, you will find the implementation of DCGAN and various advanced GAN architectures, along with experimental results for complex image generation tasks.

**DCGAN**

The DCGAN architecture is composed of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator generates data samples, typically images, from random noise. The discriminator, on the other hand, tries to distinguish between real data and fake data generated by the generator. Through adversarial training, the generator improves its ability to produce realistic data.

**Advanced GAN Experimentation**

Apart from DCGAN, this repository explores advanced GAN architectures like:

Conditional GAN (cGAN)
Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
Progressive GAN (ProGAN)
These advanced architectures offer unique features and improvements for image generation tasks.

**Requirements**

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

**pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib**
