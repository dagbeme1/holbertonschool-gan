**Advanced GAN Experimentation for Complex Image Generation**

This repository is dedicated to advanced Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) experimentation, with a focus on generating complex images using deep learning techniques. Explore and implement cutting-edge GAN architectures and train them to generate stunning and intricate visual content.

**Introduction**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained immense popularity for their ability to generate high-quality synthetic data, particularly images. This repository goes beyond basic GANs and explores advanced GAN architectures, each offering unique advantages for complex image generation tasks.

**Implemented GAN Architectures**

Conditional GAN (cGAN): Allows you to conditionally generate images based on specific attributes or labels.

Wasserstein GAN (WGAN): Utilizes the Wasserstein distance metric to improve stability and training in GANs.

Progressive GAN (ProGAN): A state-of-the-art GAN that gradually increases image resolution during training, resulting in stunningly detailed images.

**Requirements**

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

**Training Your GAN**

Train the GAN of your choice by running its respective training script:

For cGAN: python train_cgan.py
For WGAN: python train_wgan.py
For ProGAN: python train_progan.py
Monitor the training progress, and the GAN will learn to generate complex images.

**Results**

The trained GAN models will produce complex and visually appealing images. The generated images can be found in the generated_samples directory.

**Contributing**

Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to report issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements to help advance the capabilities of GANs for complex image generation.
