**Notes**

**This took a long time to work on. This first time I did get a lot clearer images off numbers but I had a brokenpipe at some point which I to fix. Was not able to figure it out so I did restart and I did cut the buffer size low and increased the batch size to speed things up. Doing this changes the images generated into a more blurry image. Still was not able to figure out what the output image is just because the image did not reply display after long hours of running and generating a lot images. They looked the same but not all of them**

**Notes**

**With this, after experimenting with large batch sizes, there was a little more speed in running my code in collab. But I did realize that it occupied more memory space when I increased the batch size. The image improved a little bit also but not like a drastic change.**

**Notes**

**This took more training epochs for it to converge and also the image quality was not the best. I would say this had way more low quality images than baseline. Adding more layers to this caused my training time to be slow. I would say this was way more challenging than all the experiments or test i should say.**

**Notes**

    **Lowering precision like changing float32 to float16 I would say did increase the running time or speed of the training time. Also this required a lower or less memory. The image still had a slight change but not too much that you can notice off the jump. had to pay attention to see some changes in it.**
