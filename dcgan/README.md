**Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)**

This is a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) implementation using TensorFlow and Keras. DCGANs are a class of generative models that have been successful in generating realistic images.

**Overview**

The DCGAN architecture consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator takes random noise as input and generates data samples that resemble the training data. The discriminator, on the other hand, tries to distinguish between real data and the data generated by the generator.

This adversarial training process leads to the generator improving over time, ultimately generating high-quality data that is indistinguishable from real data.

**Requirements**

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
